## As API's are slow it may take 1-2 min to display todo list
#  Frontend (React): 
User interface to create, read, update, and
delete (CRUD) to-do items. Makes HTTP requests (using fetch or
axios) to the backend API.

PUT, DELETE). Connects to MongoDB via Mongoose to manage
data
# Database (MongoDB with Mongoose):
